# About Me

<p> Since 2022, I am working as a PostDoc scientist in Visualisation group of Department of Visual Computing and Enginnering, Institute for Software Technology, German Aerospace Center (DLR), Germany. I am based in Braunschweig office. In my role, I am responsible of conceiving, developing and successfull dissimenination of a Visual Analytics based solutions to the projects. My current projects are related to Visual Analytics in Data Manangement, Visual Analytics of Digital Twins, Visual Analytics of Mobility and Epidemiology. 
 <br> <br>
I did my PhD in 2021  with thesis on "Domain Knowledge Based Visualisation Recommendation System" under the supervision of Professor Birgitta KÃ¶nig-Reis from the Friedrich Schiller University Jena, Germany. During my Phd, I was also employed by the university as a Research Assistant. I did my Master Research (MRes) degree in Computer Aided Decision Support System with Internship in 'Visualising Quality of Open Datasets' from  Ecole Polytechnique Tours France, in 2014. 
<br><br>
My research interests include application of visual analytics solutions in data management, infrastructure and subsystem analysis, mobility and transportation. human computer interaction (HCI), natural language processing (NLP), spatio-temporal data, graph analytics and uncertainty visualisation.
